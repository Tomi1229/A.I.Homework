# Interview Chatbot Project

This project is a job interview preparation chatbot built with FastAPI and OpenAI's GPT model. The chatbot helps users prepare for job interviews by generating relevant questions based on the user's input. It simulates an interviewer's role, asking questions about the job title, the user's qualifications, and providing feedback at the end of the interview.

## Project Structure

- **Backend**: The backend is built with **FastAPI**, which handles the API requests for generating interview questions and receiving user responses. The backend also communicates with the OpenAI GPT model to generate intelligent responses.
- **Frontend**: The frontend is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It provides an interface for the user to interact with the chatbot.

## Features

- Generate interview questions based on a given job title or topic.
- Allow the user to answer the generated questions.
- Provide feedback at the end of the interview based on user responses.
- Simulate a real-life job interview scenario with automatic follow-up questions.
